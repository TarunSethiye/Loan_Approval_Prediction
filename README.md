I recently completed an exciting Loan Approval Prediction project, where I built a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details.

🔍 Key Highlights:

✅ Data preprocessing: Handled missing values and transformed categorical & numerical features

✅ Feature Engineering: Optimized dataset for model performance

✅ Model Building: Implemented Logistic Regression, KNN, and other ML algorithms

✅ Achieved 83.1% accuracy on training data

✅ Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) for analysis and visualization
